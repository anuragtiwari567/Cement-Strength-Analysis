# Cement Strength Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict the compressive strength of concrete based on various input variables. The dataset contains information about the composition of concrete mixtures and the corresponding concrete strength. The goal is to build a regression model that accurately predicts the compressive strength.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following variables:

1. **Cement (component 1)**: Quantitative, measured in kg/m3. Represents the amount of cement in the concrete mixture.
2. **Blast Furnace Slag (component 2)**: Quantitative, measured in kg/m3. Represents the amount of blast furnace slag in the concrete mixture.
3. **Fly Ash (component 3)**: Quantitative, measured in kg/m3. Represents the amount of fly ash in the concrete mixture.
4. **Water (component 4)**: Quantitative, measured in kg/m3. Represents the amount of water in the concrete mixture.
5. **Superplasticizer (component 5)**: Quantitative, measured in kg/m3. Represents the amount of superplasticizer in the concrete mixture.
6. **Coarse Aggregate (component 6)**: Quantitative, measured in kg/m3. Represents the amount of coarse aggregate in the concrete mixture.
7. **Fine Aggregate (component 7)**: Quantitative, measured in kg/m3. Represents the amount of fine aggregate in the concrete mixture.
8. **Age**: Quantitative, measured in days (1~365). Represents the age of the concrete sample.
9. **Concrete Compressive Strength**: Quantitative, measured in MPa. The target variable we want to predict.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

1. `data/`: Contains the dataset file (e.g., `concrete_data.csv`).
2. `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model building.
3. `models/`: Trained regression models (e.g., `linear_regression_model.pkl`).
4. `src/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
5. `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages (e.g., `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`).
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the data and build models.
4. Use the trained model to predict concrete compressive strength for new samples.

## Usage
1. Load the dataset (`concrete_data.csv`) using the provided Python script.
2. Preprocess the data (handle missing values, scale features, etc.).
3. Train a regression model (e.g., linear regression, random forest) using the processed data.
4. Evaluate the model's performance (e.g., RMSE, R-squared).
5. Save the trained model for future predictions.
